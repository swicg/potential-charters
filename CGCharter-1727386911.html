      The Social Web Incubator Community Group (also known as SocialCG, or
      SWICG) is the successor of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/Socialwg">Social Web Working Group</a>, which ran from
      2014 to 2018.
    </p>
    <h2 id="goals">
      Goals
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Provide space to collaborate and coordinate for implementors who are

        (2014-2017), and related technologies.
      </li>
      <li>
        Incubate new proposals which build on or complement the Social Web WG
        recommendations.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="scope-of-work">

    <p>
      The group will develop and support the development of test suites and reference implementations for the above specifications and extensions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The group will provide an interface and touchpoint for other W3C groups and external organizations working with these specifications.
    </p>
    <p>
      The group will provide information for implementers of these specifications, including best practices, tutorials, and examples.
    </p>

      Non-Normative Reports
    </h3>
    <p>
      The group may produce other Community Group Reports within the scope of
      this charter but that are not Specifications, for instance use cases,
      requirements, or white papers.
    </p>
    <h3 id="test-suites">
      Test Suites and Other Software
    </h3>
    <p>
      The group MAY produce test suites to support the Specifications. Please
      see the GitHub LICENSE file for test suite contribution licensing
      information.
    </p>
    <h2 id="process">
      Community and Business Group Process
    </h2>
    <p>
      The group operates under the <a href=
      "https://www.w3.org/community/about/process/">Community and Business
      Group Process</a>. Terms in this Charter that conflict with those of the
      Community and Business Group Process are void.
    </p>
    <p>
      As with other Community Groups, W3C seeks organizational licensing
      commitments under the <a href=
      'https://www.w3.org/community/about/process/cla/'>W3C Community
      Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</a>. When people request to
      participate without representing their organization's legal interests,
      W3C will in general approve those requests for this group with the
      following understanding: W3C will seek and expect an organizational
      commitment under the CLA starting with the individual's first request to
      make a contribution to a group <a href="#deliverables">Deliverable</a>.
      The section on <a href="#contrib">Contribution Mechanics</a> describes
      how W3C expects to monitor these contribution requests.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/">W3C Code of
      Conduct</a> applies to participation in
      this group.
    </p>

    <h2 id="worklimit">
      Work Limited to Charter Scope
    </h2>
    <p>
      The group will not publish Specifications on topics other than those
      listed under <a href="#specifications">Specifications</a> above. See
      below for <a href="#charter-change">how to modify the charter</a>.
    </p>
    <h2 id="contrib">
      Contribution Mechanics
    </h2>
    <p>
      Substantive Contributions to Specifications can only be made by Community
      Group Participants who have agreed to the <a href=
      "https://www.w3.org/community/about/process/cla/">W3C Community
      Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Specifications created in the Community Group must use the <a href=
      "http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2015/copyright-software-and-document">
      W3C Software and Document License</a>. All other documents produced by
      the group should use that License where possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Community Group participants agree to make all contributions in the
      GitHub repo the group is using for the particular document. This may be
      in the form of a pull request (preferred), by raising an issue, or by
      adding a comment to an existing issue.
    </p>
    <p id="githublicense">
      All Github repositories attached to the Community Group must contain a
      copy of the <a href=
      "https://github.com/w3c/licenses/blob/master/CG-CONTRIBUTING.md">CONTRIBUTING</a>
      and <a href=

      files.
    </p>
    <h2 id="transparency">
      Transparency
    </h2>
    <p>
      The group will conduct all of its technical work in public, e.g. on the <a
      href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-swicg/">public-swicg@w3.org
      mailing list</a>,
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/SocialCG">w3.org SocialCG wiki</a>, and
      git repositories cloned in the <a
      href="https://github.com/swicg">github.com/swicg/ Organization</a>
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      Meetings may be restricted to Community Group participants, but a public
      summary or minutes must be posted to the <a
      href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-swicg/">public-swicg@w3.org
      mailing list</a>.
    </p>
    <h2 id="decision">
      Decision Process
    </h2>
    <p>
      This group will seek to make decisions where there is consensus. The
      Group makes decisions in the following ways: either Committers assess
      consensus; the Chair assesses consensus; or, where consensus isn't
      clear, there is a <a href="#calls-for-consensus">Call for Consensus</a>
      [CfC] (see below) to allow multi-day
      online feedback for a proposed course of action.
      After discussion and due consideration of different opinions, a decision
      should be publicly recorded (where GitHub is used as the resolution
      of an Issue).
    </p>
    <p>
      If substantial disagreement remains (e.g. the group is divided) and the
      group needs to decide an Issue in order to continue to make progress, the
      Committers will choose an alternative that had substantial support (with
      a vote of Committers if necessary). Individuals who disagree with the
      choice are strongly encouraged to take ownership of their objection by
      taking ownership of an alternative fork. This is explicitly allowed (and
      preferred to blocking progress) with a goal of letting implementation
      experience inform which spec is ultimately chosen by the group to move
      ahead with.
    </p>
    <p>
      To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any
      resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face
      meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.
      A <a href="#calls-for-consensus">call for consensus</a> (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions.
    </p>
    <h3 id="calls-for-consensus">
      Calls for Consensus
    </h3>
    <p>
      A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions via
      email to public-swicg@w3.org. The presence of formal resolutions will be
      indicated by a "CfC" prefix in the subject line of an email on the list.
      Additional outreach to community venues for more affirmative consent is
      strongly encouraged.
    </p>
    <p>
      There will be
      a response period of 14 days. Any group participant may object to a
      decision reached at an online or in-person meeting within 14 days of
      publication of the decision, provided that they include
      clear reasons for their objection grounded in the scope and documented
      goals of the CG and its work items.
    </p>
    <p>
      If no sustained objections are raised by the
      end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have
      consensus as a resolution of the Community Group, i.e., a group decision.
      All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and
      until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the
      discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chairs will facilitate discussion to try to resolve the
      objection according to this decision process.
      It is the Chairs' responsibility to ensure that the decision process is
      fair, respects the consensus of the CG, and does not unreasonably favour
      or discriminate against any group participant or their employer.
    </p>

    <h2 id="chairs">
      Chair Selection
    </h2>
    <p>
      Participants in this group choose their Chair(s) and can replace their
      Chair(s) at any time using whatever means they prefer. However, if 5
      participants, no two from the same organisation, call for an election,
      the group must use the following process to replace any current Chair(s)
      with a new Chair, consulting the Community Development Lead on election
      operations (e.g., voting infrastructure and using
      <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2777">RFC 2777</a>).
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Participants announce their candidacies. Participants have 14 days to
        announce their candidacies, but this period ends as soon as all
        participants have announced their intentions. If there is only one
        candidate, that person becomes the Chair. If there are two or more
        candidates, there is a vote. Otherwise, nothing changes.
      </li>
      <li>Participants vote. Participants have 21 days to vote for a single
        candidate, but this period ends as soon as all participants have voted.
        The individual who receives the most votes, no two from the same
        organisation, is elected chair. In case of a tie, RFC2777 is used to
        break the tie. An elected Chair may appoint co-Chairs.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Participants dissatisfied with the outcome of an election may ask the
      Community Development Lead to intervene. The Community Development Lead,
      after evaluating the election, may take any action including no action.
    </p>

    <h2 id="task-forces">
      Task Forces
    </h2>
    <p>
      Task Forces are lightweight organizational subsets of the Community Group
      that serve to channel work and attention to tasks (and allow others to
      "tune out" of the many topics and work items proceeding in parallel that
      are  less pressing for them). They can schedule their own topic calls
      (i.e. public, minuted meetings on the CG calendar) and can tag niche email threads with the name of their task force as a courtesy to the rest of the group. When minutes from task-force specific topic calls are uploaded, they are marked by task force name. "Task Forces" are spun up by community group resolution, usually to work on a work item at any stage of formalization or to accomplish some other objective, and can be spun down or change scope at any time by internal consensus. The convener of a task force does NOT need to be the "champion" of a work item being coordinated in it, NOR do they need to be a Committer.
    </p>

    <h2 id="committers">
      Committers
    </h2>

    <p>
      A <dfn>Committer</dfn> is authorized to make changes to one or more GitHub repositories that are managed by the group. Participants can earn Committer status through a history of useful contributions. Committer status is granted through consensus, as discussed in <a href="#decision">Decision Process</a>. There is no limit to the number of Committers in the group or on a repository. There is no time limit on Committer status. Each repository for ongoing work items should have at least one active Committer other than the Chairs. Chair(s) can revoke Committer status for any reason, and will notify the community. A Committer can give up the role voluntarily.
    </p>

    <h2 id="past-decisions">
      Decisions made prior to Adoption of this Charter
    </h2>

    <p>
      From 2017 to 2024, the SocialCG operated under the same process as its predecessor, the Social Web Working Group. Where they conflict, the
      terms of this charter supercede any decisions made during that time. All decisions made during that time that are compatible with this charter stand.
    </p>

    <h2 id="charter-change">
      Amendments to this Charter
    </h2>
    <p>
      The group can decide to work on a proposed amended charter, editing the
      text using the <a href="#decision">Decision Process</a> described above.
      The decision on whether to adopt the amended charter is made by
      conducting a 30-day vote on the proposed new charter. The new charter, if
      approved, takes effect on either the proposed date in the charter itself,
      or 7 days after the result of the election is announced, whichever is
      later. A new charter must receive 2/3 of the votes cast in the approval
      vote to pass. The group may make simple corrections to the charter such
      as deliverable dates by the simpler group decision process rather than
      this charter amendment process. The group will use the amendment process
      for any substantive changes to the goals, scope, deliverables, decision
      process or rules for amending the charter.
