	  <h2>Success Criteria</h2>

    <p>
      In order to update the Recommendation, each substantive change is expected to have
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#implementation-experience">at least two independent
        implementations</a> of every feature defined in the specification, where interoperability can be
      verified by passing open test suites, and two or more implementations interoperating with each other.

    </p>

    <p>
      Each substantive change should contain a section detailing all known security and privacy implications
      for implementers, authors, and end users.
    </p>

    <p>
      To promote interoperability, all changes made to specifications should have
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/02/testing-policy.html">tests</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This Working Group expects to follow the TAG <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/design-principles/">Web
        Platform Design Principles</a>.
    </p>
  	</section>

      <section id="coordination">
        <h2>Coordination</h2>
        <p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/documentreview/#how_to_get_horizontal_review">horizontal review</a> for
          accessibility, internationalization, privacy, and security with the
          relevant Working and Interest Groups, and with the
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/other/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>.
          Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track
          document transition, including
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>.
          The Working Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the
          horizontal review groups throughout development of each specification.
          The Working Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before
          first entering
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a>
          and is encouraged to proactively notify the horizontal review groups
          when major changes occur in a specification following a review.
        </p>

        <p>
          This group is expected to coordinate with the
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/cg/socialcg/">Social Web Incubator Community Group</a>
          on consensus-based proposals related to content changes for the
          ActivityPub Maintenance Working Group Deliverables.
          The Chairs of this group should reject proposals that are incompatible
          with this Charter.

          To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 6 or more active
          participants for its duration, including representatives from the key
          implementors of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads
          for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test
          Leads are expected to contribute half of a working day per week towards
          the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process,
          per the
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#Consensus">W3C Process Document (section 5.2.1, Consensus)</a>.
          Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal,
          which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other
          reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus
          is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views
          presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision
          along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any
          resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face
          meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for
          example, via email, GitHub issue or web-based survey), with a response
          period from <span id='cfc'><i class="todo">[pick a duration within:]
          one week to 10 working days</i></span>, depending on the chair's
          evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the
          resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the
          Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless
          and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the
          discretion of the Chairs.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 5.2.3, Deciding by Vote)</a>
