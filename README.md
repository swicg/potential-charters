# Potential SWICG Charters

Discussion of potential CG and WG charters

## Contributing

The goal here is to iterate these charter documents to a point where they can be
ratified, via "single-topic" PRs (each addressing one issue or replacing one 
`class="remove"` section with content).

When in doubt, email the mailing list!

We recommend previewing your own PRs by simply opening the HTML file in a browser
(locally), and previewing those of others by clicking into the "Files" view of
each PR and selecting "View File" from the `...` menu, then "download".
Note: on mobile, this _may_ download as a `.txt` file, which may need to be
renamed/retyped locally before opening.)
